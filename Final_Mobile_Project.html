          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            The history of hip-hop originated in the late 60th of the 20th century and continues to evolve to the present day. That what began more than 30 years ago, boiled over into a particular movement and culture.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Hip-hop culture originated in New York among black and Latino ghetto. Street culture existed for centuries in all countries. But in USA, a country of ghettos, it had a special isolation from society.And then she spilled on the streets of white quarters and then to the masses - the show-business, discos, cinema, etc.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Hip-hop culture has been internationally recognized with the 70th. Its main components are rap (MC'ing), break-dance, graffiti, street types of sports games. So, how it all started.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Despite the fact that hip-hop as a way of life originated long ago in various parts of North America, the real birthplace of it is considered to be the South Bronx - the black ghettos of New York, one of the poorest quarters. But the word "hip-hop" did not yet exist, it was invented a few years later, when already grown-up culture needed some overall title, by a legendary DJ (DJ), Africa Bambaataa.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In 1967 to South Bronx came Clive Campbell from Jamaican, who was labeled Kool Herc. He is considered to be one of the founders of hip-hop. Kool Herc became that, what later became known as "DJ". In Jamaica, the DJ was a "master" of the music system, which evolved around the lives of youth. He arranged parties, made an interesting speech-feast into the microphone. Soon he became known as MC ( "master of ceremony") - he gathered music plates, played and announced them. And when a DJ, besides making music, announced some rythmic text it became known as the word "rap".
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Soon Kool Herc for the convenience of the dancers began to repeat the instrumental breaks between verses, during which the dancers came out to the dance-floor and showed their skills. Kool Herc marked the enthusiasm of the dancers for such breaks, and naimed the term "B-Boy", "Break boys" - for those who are moving in the manner of breaks, and the dance was called breakdancing style (breaking)."MC" has become synonymous with rap, when rappers have become not only DJs but also performers, who are able to move in a special hip-hop manner.In the late 60th breakdance existed in the form of two separate dances - New York acrobatic style, which we call the lower break, and the Los Angeles-based mime (upper break). It is an acrobatic style of breaking that was originally twisted by bboys in break-dance. It became popular, after 1969, when James Brown wrote a funk-hit "The Good Foot" and performed some elements of this dance on the stage.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Bambaataa formed his own break-dancing team called Zulu Nation, which eventually grew into the organization and included rappers, DJs, graffiti artists and dancers. Zulu Nation, along with other teams contributed to promote break-dancing.Bambaataa included 5 elements into the hip-hop culture: MC'ing ( "Rapping" - rap), DJ'ing, Graffiti (Writing), Dancing (Breaking, Up-Rocking, Popping, Locking), and knowledges. The last item on his sense means that there is a lack of knowledge about hip-hop culture.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Veteran of the hip-hop and a leader of the b-boys in the 70th of XX century was Richard Colon, known as "Crazy Legs". His break-dance group "Rock Steady Crew" - one of the most vocal and motor, created a new culture of hip-hop. Brake and rap have become synonymous with hip-hop, to which also refers graffiti as one of the factors that promote the popularization of hip-hop.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Hip-hop dance can be divided into two basic types:
           
            Old school (old school hip-hop),
            New style (new school hip-hop)
           </p>
          
          <p>
            Old school (old school) includes popping, locking, breakdance. Popping in its turn is divided into boogaloo, electric boogaloo, tetris, waving, robot, egypcian, pop corn. Style "locking" became scenic standard for many black singers and MTV stars such as Janet Jackson and her dancers, as well as many others are moving in this style. In the 90th there was a new form of hip-hop, which connects traffic from the old school styles: popping, locking, break-dancing (but more focused on footwork as opposed to acrobatic style), as well as from many other styles. Gradually, penetrating into the pop culture, absorbing all the new elements and styles, transforming, hip-hop has become the leading dance direction and separated into a single direction - hip-hop.

            Rapping (also known as emceeing, MCing, spitting (bars), or rhyming) refers to "spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics". The art form can be broken down into different components, as in the book How to Rap where it is separated into “content”, “flow” (rhythm and rhyme), and “delivery”. Rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rapping is often associated with and a primary ingredient of hip hop music and reggae, but the phenomenon predates hip hop culture by centuries. It can also be found in alternative rock such as that of Cake and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Rapping is also used in Kwaito music, a genre that originated in Johannesburg, South Africa and is composed of hip hop elements. Rapping can be delivered over a beat or without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word (meaning originally "to hit") as used to describe quick speech or repartee predates the musical form. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century, and specifically meaning "to say" since the 18th. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the terms "rap" and "rapping" are so closely associated with hip hop music that many use the terms interchangeably.

            <p>
                Turntablism is the art of manipulating sounds and creating music using phonograph turntables and a DJ mixer.
                The word turntablist was coined in 1995 by DJ Babu to describe the difference between a DJ who just plays records and one who performs by touching and moving the records, stylus and mixer to manipulate sound. The new term coincided with a resurgence of the art of hiphop-style DJ-ing in the 1990s.
                John Oswald described the art: "A phonograph in the hands of a 'hiphop/scratch' artist who plays a record like an electronic washboard with a phonographic needle as a plectrum, produces sounds which are unique and not reproduced—the record player becomes a musical instrument."
                Some turntablist DJs use turntable techniques like beat mixing/matching, scratching and beat juggling. Some turntablists seek to have themselves recognized as traditional musicians capable of interacting and improvising with other performers.

            <p> Graffiti is writing or drawings that have been scribbled, scratched, or sprayed illicitly on a wall or other surface in a public place. Graffiti ranges from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings, and it has existed since ancient times, with examples dating back to Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, and the Roman Empire.
                In modern times, paint (particularly spray paint) and marker pens have become the most commonly used graffiti materials. In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner's consent is considered defacement and vandalism, which is a punishable crime.
                Graffiti may also express underlying social and political messages and a whole genre of artistic expression is based upon spray paint graffiti styles. Within hip hop culture, graffiti has evolved alongside hip hop music, b-boying, and other elements. Unrelated to hip-hop graffiti, gangs use their own form of graffiti to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities.

                 B-boying or Breaking, also called Breakdancing, is a style of street dance that originated among Black and Puerto Rican youths in New York City during the early 1970s. The dance spread worldwide due to popularity in the media, especially in regions such as South Korea, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and Japan. While diverse in the amount of variation available in the dance, b-boying consists of four kinds of movement: toprock, downrock, power moves, and freezes. B-boying is typically danced to hip-hop, funk music and especially breakbeats, although modern trends allow for much wider varieties of music along certain ranges of tempo and beat patterns.

                 Choreography is the art of designing sequences of movements in which motion, form, or both are specified. Choreography may also refer to the design itself. The word choreography literally means "dance-writing". A choreographer is one who creates choreographies by practicing the art of choreography.

                 Popping is a street dance and one of the original funk styles that came from California during the 1960s-1970s. It is based on the technique of quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk in the dancer's body, referred to as a pop or a hit. This is done continuously to the rhythm of a song in combination with various movements and poses.

                 The robot (or mannequin) is an illusionary street dance style – often confused with popping – that attempts to imitate a dancing robot or mannequin. Roboting gained fame after Michael Jackson used the dance when he performed "Dancing Machine" with his brothers, and later performed the dance during his solo career in songs such as "Billie Jean".

                 Tutting is the name given to a style of contemporary interpretive dance that focuses on the ability of the dancer to create geometric positions and movements in which predominates the ' right angle . This is usually done with a meticulous attention to the musical rhythm, typically alternating positions with the effect of stop-and-go

                 Tricking is the informal name of a type of acrobatics derived from martial arts such as sport karate incorporating techniques found in gymnastics, break dancing, and similar disciplines. Examples of incorporated techniques include the 540 kick from taekwondo, the butterfly twist from wushu, and the double leg from capoeira. The sport aims to create an "aesthetic blend of flips, kicks, and twists." Tricking differs from similar arts in that expression and exploration are more heavily favored. An individual who practices tricking is typically referred to as a "trickster" or "tricker".

                Waving is a dance style composed of a series of movements that give the appearance that a wave is traversing a dancer's body.
                Waving is thought to have grown out of the popping and funk dance scene and is often seen combined with popping and its related styles. Today, however, there are many practitioners who practice waving without involving popping, such as David Elsewhere. Waving is also seen combined with liquid dancing, especially when practiced within electronica communities.
